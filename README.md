The Environment class represents the grid environment where the cleaning robot operates. 
It has methods to initialize the environment with obstacles, check if a cell is an obstacle or cleaned, 
mark a cell as cleaned, and draw the environment on the screen using turtle graphics.

2. Hill climbing algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in the context of visiting various places in Windhoek.
